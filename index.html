            Welcome to my personal page! I am a Customer Success Manager with over 7 years of experience in steering multi-disciplinary teams and guiding clients to success. I hail from New Delhi, India and have been living in Toronto, Canada for the last 10 years. I have a Masters in Computer Science and minor in Management. I have been in the Customer Success space for around 6 years now and I love working with customers. I have been heavily engaged in creating playbooks/success plans for CS teams, and have recently started accessing CS tools in search for the best one. I am thrilled for this opportunity to join an amazing team like yours and I am excited to contribute and collaborate with all of you. I look forward to learning from each of you as we work together to drive success for Vercel.

            A little bit about me; the last couple of years have been super excitng; from getting married to my girlfriend of 5 years, to getting a new house and dog, and the best thing to ever happen - getting blessed with a son! These past years have taught me to how to better manage my time and appreciate all the small things in life. My wife and I love travelling, and have travelled to 6 countries in the last 18 months, with 3 more planned for this year. I love reading, I am a big Harry Potter fan and I can play a little bit of guitar.

            Again, I am blown away how great Vercel is doing, and I am looking forward to talking with you all soon, thanks!

            The most recent tool I have learned is Vercel, though not fully; but I love how easy it is to use and I am having fun with it. In my personal life I have recently started learning swimming. Practicing it every day, to become perfect!
